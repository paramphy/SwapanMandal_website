	abstract = {We report on the bistability in spin states of spin crossover ({SCO}) compound Fe(phen) 2 ({NCS}) 2 in polymer (polypyrrole) by frequency (1–100 {kHz}) and temperature dependent (305–457 K) electrical conductivity measurements. The structure and growth of {SCO} compounds in conducting polymer are obtained by scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and optical absorption measurements. The thermal dependence of ac conductivity σ ( \$ømega\$ ) shows the clear formation of a hysteresis loop in its cooling and heating cycle due to the difference in conductivity in high spin and low spin state. The size, shape and width of the hysteresis loops are found to be critically dependent on the applied frequency and/or the ratio between {SCO} and polymer. The ac conductivity is found to exhibit a dispersive behavior following Jonscher's law: σ ( \$ømega\$ ) ∝ \$ømega\$ n below a critical frequency \$ømega\$ c , above which it is found to monotonically decrease with increasing frequency. The thermal dependence of the exponent n and \$ømega\$ c is also explored. The charge transport phenomena are explained in the framework of hopping of charge carriers. The data reveals that addition of polymer can play an important role to tune the conductivity of {SCO} compounds and its spin state dependence characteristics which may be quite helpful for fabricating future spin-based devices. Temperature dependent magnetic susceptibility measurement also confirms the spin transition behavior of the {SCO}/ppy composite samples. These {SCO}/ppy composite samples can be taken as the reliable nanomaterials fabricated with the concept of future spin based nanoarchitectonics.},

	doi = {10.1051/epjap/2016160258},
	abstract = {Spin crossover molecular complex Fe(phen)2({NCS})2 in thin film form (20-300 nm) is obtained by simple dip-coating technique on glass substrates. The growth of the molecular films is confirmed by optical and X-ray diffraction data. The morphology of the samples shows distributed nanocrystals with an average size ca. 12 nm. We measure the current (I)-voltage (V) characteristics of a device with 300 nm film thickness and show that application of electric field can induce spin state switching. The electric field experienced by individual nanocrystals separated by nanometric gap is supposed to be quite high and is plausibly playing the crucial role in instigating switching in molecular nanocrystals. The result is quite significant towards developing room temperature molecular spin cross-over switching devices in the nanoscale limit.},
