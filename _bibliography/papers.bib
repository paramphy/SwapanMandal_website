	abstract = {We report on the bistability in spin states of spin crossover (SCO) compound Fe(phen) 2 (NCS) 2 in polymer (polypyrrole) by frequency (1–100 kHz) and temperature dependent (305–457 K) electrical conductivity measurements. The structure and growth of SCO compounds in conducting polymer are obtained by scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and optical absorption measurements. The thermal dependence of ac conductivity σ ( \$ømega\$ ) shows the clear formation of a hysteresis loop in its cooling and heating cycle due to the difference in conductivity in high spin and low spin state. The size, shape and width of the hysteresis loops are found to be critically dependent on the applied frequency and/or the ratio between SCO and polymer. The ac conductivity is found to exhibit a dispersive behavior following Jonscher's law: σ ( \$ømega\$ ) ∝ \$ømega\$ n below a critical frequency \$ømega\$ c , above which it is found to monotonically decrease with increasing frequency. The thermal dependence of the exponent n and \$ømega\$ c is also explored. The charge transport phenomena are explained in the framework of hopping of charge carriers. The data reveals that addition of polymer can play an important role to tune the conductivity of SCO compounds and its spin state dependence characteristics which may be quite helpful for fabricating future spin-based devices. Temperature dependent magnetic susceptibility measurement also confirms the spin transition behavior of the SCO/ppy composite samples. These SCO/ppy composite samples can be taken as the reliable nanomaterials fabricated with the concept of future spin based nanoarchitectonics.},

	abstract = {A successful attempt to grow carbon nanotubes (CNTs) by electrodeposition technique for the first time is reported here. Carbon nanotubes were grown on Si (001) substrate using acetonitrile (1\% v/v) and water as electrolyte at an applied d.c. potential ∼20 V. The films were characterized by X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), Raman, optical absorbance, Fourier Transform Infra Red spectroscopy (FTIR) and Electron Spin Resonance (ESR) measurements. The effect of magnetic field on the growth of nanotubes was studied critically. It was found that the presence of magnetic field during electro-deposition played a crucial role on the growth of carbon nanotubes and hence the electronic properties. Photoluminescence (PL) studies indicated band edge luminescence ∼0.72–0.83 eV. Field emission studies indicated lower turn-on voltage and higher current density for films deposited with magnetic field.},

	abstract = {We report here the synthesis and dielectric characteristics of lead-free methylammonium bismuth chloride ({MABiCl}) and bromine (Br) doped methylammonium bismuth chloride ({MABiBrCl}) powders. The dielectric characteristics of the samples (pressed powder pellet) measured in the frequency range 1 Hz to 1 {MHz} and temperature range 333–403 K indicate complex electrical transport in these halide perovskite materials. We have observed that the transport is dominated by longrange hopping of carriers and localized charges above and below a critical frequency respectively. The experimental data are fitted with the theoretical models considering grains, grain boundary, and contacts effects and made a comprehensive analysis. The activation energy obtained from ac electrical conductivity measurements is found to be relatively higher for the Br doped {MABiBrCl} than undoped {MABiCl}, which might explain some of the properties reported on solar cells and optoelectronic devices.},
