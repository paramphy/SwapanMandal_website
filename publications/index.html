Cu substitution affects the spin orbit coupling (SOC) and interatomic electron correlation (U) in the transition metal site which in turn modifies the physical properties. XPS measurement reveal that each Cu2+ converts Ir4+ to double amount of Ir5+ ions. We observe metal to insulator transition (T_MI ) around 120 K. At lower temperature in the insulating phase below 50 K the temperature dependence of resistance follows power law dependence and the magnitude of the exponent increases with Cu concentration. The temperature dependent thermopower was observed to follow the electrical resistivity till 50 K, except for a sudden drop in thermopower at temperature less than 50 K was observed. We find negligible Hall voltage in the metallic regime of the samples but a sudden Hall voltage is developed at very low temperatures below 50 K. We observe bifurcation in zero field cooled and field cooled (ZFC-FC) magnetization measurement, exchange bias and negative magnetoresistance and in all these the magnitude increases with increase in Cu doping concentration. We observe linear specific heat and the coefficient of it decreases with Cu doping.

The process shows some intriguing outcomes like uniform surface morphology of the perovskite layer, high open-circuit voltage and good fill-factor. The film shows improved uniform morphology and surface coverage with flakes (dimension 570 nm × 360 nm, thickness ∼ 100–200 nm). The solar cell device shows an open-circuit voltage of about 496 mV and a fill factor 0.55. The improved morphology of the perovskite layer with reduced number of defects and charge traps possibly decreases the probability of recombination of photoexcited charge carriers.

The metal insulator transition temperature (TMI) decreases with increase in Nd content, but always coincides with the magnetic irreversibility temperature (field-induced moment). Resistivity below TMI does not fit with either activated (gap) or any power-law (gapless) dependence. The Curie constant shows the surprising result that Nd induces singlet correlation (reduction of paramoment) in the Ir sublattice. Magnetoresistance is negative at low temperatures below 10 K and increases strongly with increase in x, and varies quadratically with field switching over to a linear dependence above 50 kOe. Low-temperature specific heat shows a Schottky peak, coming from Nd moments, showing the existence of a doublet split in the Nd energy level, arising from the f−d exchange interaction. All materials show the presence of a linear specific heat in the insulating region. The coefficient of linear specific heat for x=0.0 does not vary with the external magnetic field, but varies superlinearly for x=1.0 materials. We argue that linear specific heat probably rules out weakly correlated phases such as Weyl fermions. We propose that with the introduction of Nd at the Eu site, the system evolves from a chiral spin liquid with gapless spinon excitations with a very small charge gap to a Kondo-type interaction superposed on a chiral spin liquid coexisting with long-range antiferromagnetic ordering. A huge increase of magnetoresistance with increase in Nd concentrations shows the importance of Kondo scattering in the chiral spin-liquid material by rare-earth moments.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="year">2019</h2> <ol class="bibliography"><li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"></div> <div id="mondal_frequency_2019" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Frequency Dependent Charge Transport and Spin State Switching Characteristics of Fe(phen) 2 (NCS) 2 in Polymer</div> <div class="author">Mondal, Chaitali, Nanda Goswami, M.

The structure and growth of SCO compounds in conducting polymer are obtained by scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and optical absorption measurements. The thermal dependence of ac conductivity σ ( \ømega ) shows the clear formation of a hysteresis loop in its cooling and heating cycle due to the difference in conductivity in high spin and low spin state. The size, shape and width of the hysteresis loops are found to be critically dependent on the applied frequency and/or the ratio between SCO and polymer. The ac conductivity is found to exhibit a dispersive behavior following Jonscher’s law: σ ( \ømega ) ∝ \ømega n below a critical frequency \ømega c , above which it is found to monotonically decrease with increasing frequency. The thermal dependence of the exponent n and \ømega c is also explored. The charge transport phenomena are explained in the framework of hopping of charge carriers. The data reveals that addition of polymer can play an important role to tune the conductivity of SCO compounds and its spin state dependence characteristics which may be quite helpful for fabricating future spin-based devices. Temperature dependent magnetic susceptibility measurement also confirms the spin transition behavior of the SCO/ppy composite samples.

Below 50K the polarons begins to strongly localize causing loss of moment and the electrical transport is governed by variable range hopping (VRH) conduction. The system shows glassy spin relaxation below 50K, which presumably evolves into cluster spin glass at 12 K due to short range ordering of the canted moments.

As a result, we could systematically fabricate a single conjugated polydiacetylene chain at designated positions. Subsequently, we developed a novel method (‘chemical soldering’) for connecting the conjugated polymer chains to single organic molecules. The connection of two polydiacetylene chains to a single phthalocyanine molecule was demonstrated. Nanoscale characteristics of the connection were also experimentally and theoretically investigated.

This involves two issues: how to create conductive nanowires at designated positions, and how to ensure chemical bonding between the nanowires and functional molecules. Here, we present a novel method that solves both issues. Relevant functional molecules are placed on a self-assembled monolayer of diacetylene compound. A probe tip of a scanning tunneling microscope is then positioned on the molecular row of the diacetylene compound to which the functional molecule is adsorbed, and a conductive polydiacetylene nanowire is fabricated by initiating chain polymerization by stimulation with the tip. Since the front edge of chain polymerization necessarily has a reactive chemical species, the created polymer nanowire forms chemical bonding with an encountered molecular element. We name this spontaneous reaction "chemical soldering". First-principles theoretical calculations are used to investigate the structures and electronic properties of the connection.

Such chain polymerization that happens in self-assembled monolayers (SAM) of diacetylene compound molecules, which results in a π-conjugated linear polydiacetylene nanowire, varies in its rate P depending on domains in the SAM and substrate materials. While the arrangement of diacetylene molecules is identical in every domain on a graphite substrate, it varies in different domains on a MoS(2) substrate. This structural variation enables us to investigate how P is affected by molecular geometry. An important determining factor of P is the distance between two carbon atoms which are to be bound by polymerization reaction, R; as R decreases by 0.1 nm, P increases ∼2 times. P for a MoS(2) substrate is ∼4 times higher (with the same value of R) than that for a graphite substrate because of higher mobility of molecules. The exciting correlation of the chain polymerization rate to the geometrical structure of the diacetylene molecules brings a deeper understanding of the mechanism of chain polymerization kinetics.
