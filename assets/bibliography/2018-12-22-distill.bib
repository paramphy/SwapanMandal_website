	abstract = {We report on the bistability in spin states of spin crossover ({SCO}) compound Fe(phen) 2 ({NCS}) 2 in polymer (polypyrrole) by frequency (1–100 {kHz}) and temperature dependent (305–457 K) electrical conductivity measurements. The structure and growth of {SCO} compounds in conducting polymer are obtained by scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and optical absorption measurements. The thermal dependence of ac conductivity σ ( \$ømega\$ ) shows the clear formation of a hysteresis loop in its cooling and heating cycle due to the difference in conductivity in high spin and low spin state. The size, shape and width of the hysteresis loops are found to be critically dependent on the applied frequency and/or the ratio between {SCO} and polymer. The ac conductivity is found to exhibit a dispersive behavior following Jonscher's law: σ ( \$ømega\$ ) ∝ \$ømega\$ n below a critical frequency \$ømega\$ c , above which it is found to monotonically decrease with increasing frequency. The thermal dependence of the exponent n and \$ømega\$ c is also explored. The charge transport phenomena are explained in the framework of hopping of charge carriers. The data reveals that addition of polymer can play an important role to tune the conductivity of {SCO} compounds and its spin state dependence characteristics which may be quite helpful for fabricating future spin-based devices. Temperature dependent magnetic susceptibility measurement also confirms the spin transition behavior of the {SCO}/ppy composite samples. These {SCO}/ppy composite samples can be taken as the reliable nanomaterials fabricated with the concept of future spin based nanoarchitectonics.},

We have observed that the transport is dominated by longrange hopping of carriers and localized charges above and below a critical frequency respectively. The experimental data are fitted with the theoretical models considering grains, grain boundary, and contacts effects and made a comprehensive analysis. The activation energy obtained from ac electrical conductivity measurements is found to be relatively higher for the Br doped {MABiBrCl} than undoped {MABiCl}, which might explain some of the properties reported on solar cells and optoelectronic devices.},

This involves two issues: how to create conductive nanowires at designated positions, and how to ensure chemical bonding between the nanowires and functional molecules. Here, we present a novel method that solves both issues. Relevant functional molecules are placed on a self-assembled monolayer of diacetylene compound. A probe tip of a scanning tunneling microscope is then positioned on the molecular row of the diacetylene compound to which the functional molecule is adsorbed, and a conductive polydiacetylene nanowire is fabricated by initiating chain polymerization by stimulation with the tip. Since the front edge of chain polymerization necessarily has a reactive chemical species, the created polymer nanowire forms chemical bonding with an encountered molecular element. We name this spontaneous reaction "chemical soldering". First-principles theoretical calculations are used to investigate the structures and electronic properties of the connection. We demonstrate that two conductive polymer nanowires are connected to a single phthalocyanine molecule. A resonant tunneling diode formed by this method is discussed.},

The properties of \${\textbackslash}gamma\$ -Fe 2 O 3 nanoparticles without silica were compared with those on silica spheres. Both the nanoparticle assemblages were characterized by X-ray diffraction ({XRD}), transmission electron microscope ({TEM}), Mössbauer (20, 80 and 300 K) and electron paramagnetic resonance ({EPR}) (80, 300 K) measurements. The {XRD} spectra clearly indicated the formation of pure \${\textbackslash}gamma\$ -Fe 2 O 3 nanoparticles and the absence of any other form of iron oxide. {TEM} images showed a uniform distribution of the nanoparticles of size \${\textbackslash}sim\$ 6 nm on the surfaces of silica spheres (diameter \${\textbackslash}sim\$ 35-60 nm). The size of the individual nanoparticles (without silica) varied within 5-6 nm. The low temperature (20 K) Mössbauer spectra consisted of a partially split sextet superimposed on a doublet. The partial magnetic splitting of the sextet at 20 K revealed the effect of surface magnetization and surface modifications of the \${\textbackslash}gamma\$ -Fe 2 O 3 nanoparticles coated on silica spheres. The gradual collapse of the partially split sextet into a doublet with increasing temperature indicated the superparamagnetic relaxation exhibited by the \${\textbackslash}gamma\$ -Fe 2 O 3 nanoparticles with/without silica. The surface magnetization arising out of mis-aligned spins at the surface as evidenced by Mössbauer spectra was further confirmed by electron paramagnetic resonance ({EPR}) studies.

Further increase in cobalt concentration (10 mol\% here) resulted in an increase in particle size ( nm) due to possible adsorption of a cobalt layer on the surface of γ-Fe2O3 nanoparticles rather than complete doping in the iron oxide lattice. The ac susceptibility measurements revealed an increase in blocking temperature ({TB}) with percentage variation in cobalt doping (2–10\%), indicating substitution of Fe3+ ions by Co2+ ions in the γ-Fe2O3 lattice.

The X-ray diffraction studies clearly show the formation of crystalline structure of {SCO} complexes. The growth of the thin films was indisputably confirmed by electron microscopy and optical studies. The optical absorption peak between 535-557 nm was clearly observed, and that corresponds to 1A1g → 1T1g ligand field absorption in undoped and metal-doped (Zn, Mn) {SCO} thin films. The high spin ({HS}) state of the {SCO} films at room temperature was confirmed by Raman spectra. The bistability of spin states is clearly revealed by the well pronounced thermal hysteresis loop in magnetization measurements. The spin transition temperature (T1/2) and loop width are found to be critically dependent on metal doping and suggested the possibility of tuning these parameters in spin-crossover thin films to design future spin-based devices.},

For a given size and a given quantum dot ({QD}) concentration, the droplet fluorescence intensity drops sharply as a function of the magnetic nanoparticle concentration.

	abstract = {Spontaneous chain polymerization of molecules initiated by a scanning tunneling microscope tip is studied with a focus on its rate-determining factors. Such chain polymerization that happens in self-assembled monolayers ({SAM}) of diacetylene compound molecules, which results in a π-conjugated linear polydiacetylene nanowire, varies in its rate P depending on domains in the {SAM} and substrate materials. While the arrangement of diacetylene molecules is identical in every domain on a graphite substrate, it varies in different domains on a {MoS}(2) substrate. This structural variation enables us to investigate how P is affected by molecular geometry. An important determining factor of P is the distance between two carbon atoms which are to be bound by polymerization reaction, R; as R decreases by 0.1 nm, P increases ∼2 times. P for a {MoS}(2) substrate is ∼4 times higher (with the same value of R) than that for a graphite substrate because of higher mobility of molecules. The exciting correlation of the chain polymerization rate to the geometrical structure of the diacetylene molecules brings a deeper understanding of the mechanism of chain polymerization kinetics. In addition, the fabrication of one-dimensional conjugated polymer nanowires on a semiconducting {MoS}(2) substrate as demonstrated here may be of immense importance in the realization of future molecular devices.},

When gold is deposited on a self-assembled monolayer of 10,12-nonacosadiynoic acid or 10,12-octadecadiynoic acid on a {MoS}2(0001) substrate, the ordered array of diacetylene moieties in the molecular layer serves as a template for the formation of ordered arrays of gold nanoparticles. In contrast, when gold is deposited on a pristine {MoS}2(0001) surface or on a molecular layer of stearic acid, the gold nanoparticles are randomly distributed on the surface. It is found that the arrangement of gold nanoparticles is largely determined by the deposition rate; faster deposition results in more ordered arrays of gold nanoparticles.

	title = {Evolution of magnetic and transport properties in Cu doped pyrochlore iridate Eu2(Ir1-{xCux})2O7},
	abstract = {We have investigated the effect of Cu substitution in Eu2(Ir1-{xCux})2O7 with the help of magnetic and transport property measurements. Cu substitution affects the spin orbit coupling ({SOC}) and interatomic electron correlation (U) in the transition metal site which in turn modifies the physical properties. {XPS} measurement reveal that each Cu2+ converts Ir4+ to double amount of Ir5+ ions. We observe metal to insulator transition (T\_MI ) around 120 K. At lower temperature in the insulating phase below 50 K the temperature dependence of resistance follows power law dependence and the magnitude of the exponent increases with Cu concentration. The temperature dependent thermopower was observed to follow the electrical resistivity till 50 K, except for a sudden drop in thermopower at temperature less than 50 K was observed. We find negligible Hall voltage in the metallic regime of the samples but a sudden Hall voltage is developed at very low temperatures below 50 K. We observe bifurcation in zero field cooled and field cooled ({ZFC}-{FC}) magnetization measurement, exchange bias and negative magnetoresistance and in all these the magnitude increases with increase in Cu doping concentration. We observe linear specific heat and the coefficient of it decreases with Cu doping. All these physical properties observed will be explained in this manuscript by invoking antiferromagnetic all-in-all-out spin ({AFM} {AIAO}) structure and onset of spin liquid ({SL}) phase.},

  abstract = {We have investigated the effect of Cu substitution in Eu2(Ir1−xCux)2O7 with the help of magnetic and transport property measurements. XPS measurement reveals that each Cu2+ converts Ir4+ to double the amount of Ir5+ ions. The metal-insulator transition temperature (TMI) is obtained around 120 K. In the insulating phase, at lower temperature below 50 K, the temperature-dependent resistivity follows a power-law dependence and the magnitude of the exponent increases with Cu concentrations. The temperature-dependent thermopower is observed to follow the electrical resistivity down to 50 K, except for a sudden drop in thermopower at temperature below 50 K. We find negligible Hall voltage in the metallic regime of the samples but a sudden Hall voltage is developed below 50 K. We observe bifurcation in zero-field-cooled and field-cooled (ZFC-FC) magnetization below irreversibility temperature, exchange bias, and negative magnetoresistance at 3 K and the magnitude of all these properties increases with Cu concentrations. In the insulating region (below 6 K) there exists a linear specific heat and its coefficient decreases with Cu doping, which indicates the reduction of spinon contribution with Cu doping.},

	abstract = {We report the synthesis and dielectric characteristics of lead-free methylammonium bismuth chloride ({MABiCl}) and Br doped methylammonium bismuth chloride ({MABiBrCl}) in powder form. The morphology of the samples showed growth of large flakes with large surface area. The band gaps of the perovskites are obtained from optical absorption data. The dielectric characteristics of the samples were measured in the frequency range 1 Hz to 1 {MHz} and temperature range 100–300 K. The data shows a complex electrical transport in these halide perovskite materials. The dielectric permittivity data shows the existence of a critical temperature at which the material undergoes a structural phase transition. The transition temperature is found to be 270 K and 266 K for {MABiCl} and {MABiBrCl} respectively. The results can be explained by certain change in orientation of methyl-ammonium ({MA}) ions as the temperature is increased.},
